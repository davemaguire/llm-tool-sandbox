# LLM Sandbox
This repository is a sandbox for experimenting with large language model 
(LLM) based tools. It contains a group of commonly used packages managed 
by Poetry to track notebooks and manage a virtual environment with the 
proper dependencies.

This is an easy environment to use for Jupyter notebooks, one-off scripts, 
or Streamlit apps. However, it is not intended to follow robust deployment 
patterns.

## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install Poetry using the instructions provided in the official 
documentation.
Navigate to the root directory of the repository.
Run poetry install to create a virtual environment and install the 
necessary packages.
## Usage
Activate the virtual environment by running poetry shell and then start 
Jupyter notebooks by running jupyter notebook or Streamlit by running 
streamlit run <app_name.py>.

You can also use this environment to run one-off scripts by simply running 
the script from the command line within the virtual environment.
