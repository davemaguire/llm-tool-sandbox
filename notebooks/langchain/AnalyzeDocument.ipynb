       "\" In this speech, President Biden addresses the American people and the world, discussing the recent aggression of Russia's Vladimir Putin in Ukraine and the US response. He outlines economic sanctions and other measures taken to hold Putin accountable, and announces the US Department of Justice's task force to go after the crimes of Russian oligarchs. He also proposes a plan to fight inflation, invest in America, and create jobs, and nominates Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. He calls for the passage of laws to reduce gun violence, protect the right to vote, and secure the border, and outlines a Unity Agenda for the Nation. He is also committed to helping lower-income veterans get VA care debt-free, and to finding out the cause of the diseases of many of our troops. He is optimistic about America's future and believes that the nation can turn every crisis into an opportunity.\""

Despite hardships, the animals rebuild the windmill and increase production. Years later, the animals are still working hard and the pigs have taken on human characteristics.
